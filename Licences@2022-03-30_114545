Three kind of licences
	1)smart                 ==> automatically          
	2)calssic               ==> physical
	3)enterprise aggrement  ==> cloud based
	
	licences are filtered by assigned and unassigned
	assigned licences are nothing but which are assigned to smart account or virtual account
	
	if we have unassigned pack which means that product autorization key doesn't assigned to any smart or virtual account
	when you click on assign to account you need to select virtual account and it will assign to infosys smart account
	
	here we have packages
	each package have multiple skews
	and each skew has multiple licences and features
	
	EX:
	PACKAGE: ==> it is a production authorized key     Infosys, Fpr130
	Top Skew: (Laptp)
	licence/feature aa -- 1      (Mouse)                                                      so now features are assigned to sa and va
	licence/feature bb -- 2      (Key board)
	licence/feature cc --3       (Os)  
	
	
	PACKAGE2:
	SKUS2:
		FEAT AA --    SO IN UI IT SHOWING AS TOTAL COUNT OF FEAT AA
		FEAT BB --
		FEAT CC --
		
		
	these are nothing but cisco products
	
	in assigned we can see only package once we assigned this pack to sa or va we can see those features in sa and va
	
	after assigning this packages in assigning filter we can see only assigned features
	
	if we serch with package we will get multiple features
	
	when we serch with package
	we will get features regarding that package but all this features may assigned to different virtual accounts
	
	SO IN UI IT WILL SHOW CONSOLIDETED FEATURES IF I HAVE FEAT AA 6 IN UI IT MAY UNDER DIFFERENT PACKS OR ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT VA
	
	
	IN UI WE CAN SEE PURCHASED INUSE AND BALANCED
	
	Purchased means total number of licence/feature
	inuse means consumed and remaining licence/feature are balanced
	
	consumption is not based on feature it is based on package first we need to select package then feature
	consumption means we need to generate a licence and we need to use it
	first we need to create a package / skew then we can create number of features
	from those features we can use partially which means we can use one and remaining or in balanced 
	
	user can buy feature wih one va and we can use those features in different vas
	
	it's called as shared quantity across all vas
